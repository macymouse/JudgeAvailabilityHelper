# Team Availability Helper App
Hello.
This is a static web app that generates views from given json files. The json files are generated from the exported tournament data when using VEX TM. The page updates using JavaScript so it will work on any web server. You do not need to install anything to run the website. The python app used to generate the json files will have its own requirements to install.

## Files
**index.html**: the web interface
**style.css**: obvious
**script.js**: obvious but has all the web interactions including countdowns, generating the view and reading jsons
